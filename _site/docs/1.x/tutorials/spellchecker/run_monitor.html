<h3 id="running-your-application">Running your application</h3>

<p>To start running your awesome first COHORTE application, you need to <a href="../../downloads">download</a> and install the COHORTE runtime platform in your local machine (see the <a href="/documentation/reference-guide/setup.html">setup section of the reference guide</a> for more information). </p>

<p>In the following, we suppose that you have a Max OS X platform. Download the archive file of the COHORTE runtime from the <a href="/downloads">downloads page</a> (e.g., cohorte-1.0.0-macosx.tar.gz).</p>

<p>Extract the dowloaded file anywhere in your file system and create the <em>environment Variable</em> <strong>$COHORTE_HOME</strong> which has as value the fullpath to <code>home</code> sub-folder of the extracted archive file (note that you can just double click on <code>home/setup.command</code> file to setup this environment variable).</p>

<p>The <code>home</code> sub-folder contains the main COHORTE runtime libraries and configuration files. Whereas the <code>base</code> folder contains user-specific bundles and configurations. To run your spellchecker application you need to:</p>

<ul>
  <li>move your spellchecker package folder to <code>base/repo</code> folder.</li>
  <li>fill the <code>base/conf/autorun_conf.js</code> file with the description of application’s components to be instantiated (see more information about <a href="/documentation/reference-guide/applications.html">the formalism in the reference guide</a>).</li>
</ul>

<p>This description defines a new application named <code>spellchecker-demo-app</code>on which four components will be instantiated. The wiring between the different components is done automatically following the service-oriented architecture (service providers and service consumers) even if one component is placed in remote nodes (see <a href="/documentation/reference-guide/applications.html">COHORTE applications reference guide</a> for more information on how to personalise your application’s architecture). </p>

<p>By default, with this minimal description, all the components will be instantiated in one Python isolate (as all the components are implemented in Python). Recall that a COHORTE Isolate is a seperate process (or a gateway) executing a set of components. The Python Isolate consists in Pelix platform hosting your different bundles as well as the needed system bundles (including the HTTP service provider). </p>

<p>COHORTE runtime components managing your application’s isolates and the distribution of components among them are located on a special purpose (static) isolate (called <code>cohorte-isolate</code>). There is one <code>cohorte-isolate</code>per node, but only one is started as a <strong>Top Isolate</strong> which manage all other isolates.  </p>

<p>Next, you need to launch your application… </p>

<p>The resulting Spell Client looks like this:</p>

<p>The important quality of this architecture is the capability to update any component without restarting the global application. This is important to allow adding new <em>Dictionary Service</em>s or updating a new efficient version of the <strong>Spell Checker</strong> component, without stopping the system and hence guaranting the continuity of business services.</p>

<p>The different application components can be deployed on different Isolates. This is important to ensure that a failure of one or more components does not affect the other ones. The isolation is managed automatically by COHORTE, this feature is explored with more details in <a href="../temper/">this tutorial</a>.</p>
